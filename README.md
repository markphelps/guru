Guru
====

Guru is the open source version of [StudioJoy](http://studiojoy.net), a SAAS member management solution for Martial Arts Studios. Guru was my initial 'working name' for [StudioJoy](http://studiojoy.net) so I chose to leave it when open sourcing.

To read more about the reasoning/development of Guru checkout my [blog](http://www.markphelps.me/).
